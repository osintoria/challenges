# Nightmare Fuel

NYPD investigated an abandoned building in Brownsville after reports of suspicious activity and missing persons. Body cam footage from the investigation showed unusual characteristics.

## Challenge Description

Analyze the provided video file to find a hidden password in the metadata.

## Objective

Your task is to examine the metadata of the provided video file to extract a concealed password.

## Key Points

* Investigation triggered by multiple reports:
  * People entering but never leaving
  * Security camera confirmation
  * Unresponsive woman sighting
  * K-9 unit unable to track scents
  * Missing audio in body cam footage

## Solution

1. Download the provided video file
2. Examine the file metadata
3. Extract the hidden password

The password is:
```
fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff
```

## Flag

```
fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff
```

## Approach

This challenge focuses on metadata analysis rather than video content. While the narrative creates an eerie atmosphere, the technical objective remains straightforward: examining file metadata to discover hidden information.

## Hints

1. The video content itself is a distraction
2. Focus on the file's properties
3. Standard metadata tools will reveal the secret

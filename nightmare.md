## Nightmare Fuel

NYPD investigated an abandoned building in Brownsville after reports of suspicious activity and missing persons. Body cam footage from the investigation showed unusual characteristics.

### Objective

Analyze provided video file to find hidden password in metadata.

### Solution Steps

1. Download provided video file  
2. Examine file metadata  
3. Extract password:

```

fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff
```

### Key Points

* Investigation triggered by:  
* People entering but never leaving  
* Security camera confirmation  
* Unresponsive woman sighting  
* K-9 unit unable to track scents  
* Missing audio in body cam footage

### Flag

The correct flag is: `fh453n3fk45b384gm$&%#fjksdfmo94853ff`

### Approach

In this CTF, the key is focusing on file metadata rather than the video content itself. The creepy narrative serves as a wrapper for a straightforward metadata examination challenge.
